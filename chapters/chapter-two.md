### ðŸ“– Chapter II


#### Serial and parallel execution

Serial execution: Following a order and not advance until the precedding step is completed.
One after another is the serially mode.

Concurrency: is based on the idea that are independent computations that can be executed in any order.


Parallelal execution: Increasing the throughput in the same time. Task independence: means processomg resources can process tasks in
whatever order they like and wherever they like, as long as the result is the same.
Embarrasignly parraelal usually refers to an algorithim with low communications needs.

Amdahl's law: The counterintuitive thought that adding more resources can executer tasks faster.
