#### ðŸ“¢ Types of comunication

- interprocess communication (IPC)

##### Shared-memory

Allows one or more tasks to communicate through common memory that appears in all their virtual adress spaces as if they were reading locally.

#### Race Condition and the `continue` statement

A race condition occurs when the timing of events causes unexpected behavior. In the provided `shared_memory.py` example, a race condition exists between the `Producer` and `Consumer` threads.

The `Consumer` could read from a memory location before the `Producer` has had a chance to write to it. Without proper handling, the `Consumer` would read the initial value (`-1`) and incorrectly proceed as if it were valid data.

The `continue` statement solves this by forcing the `Consumer` to wait. If the `Consumer` reads a `-1`, the `continue` statement skips the rest of the loop (including the part that prints the value) and starts the loop over. This ensures the `Consumer` only proceeds when it has read valid data from the `Producer`.


##### Message-passing IPC

In message-passing IPC, each task is identified by a unique name, and 
tasks interact by sending and receving mesages to and from named tasks.
The OS is responsible for delivering messages to the correct task.

Pipe: simplest from of IPC. A pipe is a unidirectional communication channel that can be used for interprocess communication. Data written to the write end of the pipe can be read from the read end of the pipe. If you need bidirectional communication, you can create two pipes.

Unnamed pipe: can only be used by related tasks(ex child-parent processes). Created using the pipe() system call. Unnamed pipes dissapear after the task finish using them.
 Pipe operatios are similar to file operations
